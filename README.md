# W:ET map source rebuilds
This repository contains modified map sources for Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory original maps. These map sources are modified to use `q3map_alphaMod` blending to achieve terrain blending, rather than rely on PCX alphamap blending. This allows mappers to take a "piece" of the map to be used elsewhere, while retaining the way the terrain looks in the original map.
